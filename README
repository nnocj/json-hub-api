🚀 json-hub-api

A flexible, secure, and lightweight JSON document storage API built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.

json-hub-api allows users or organizations to store structured JSON data in a simple document + folder system — all inside a single database table — while supporting full CRUD operations and secure access via passkeys.

🌍 Why This Exists

This project was inspired by the need for a backend that simply accepts and stores JSON data without requiring predefined schemas.

Instead of building custom backends for every small app or prototype, json-hub-api acts as a:

JSON-as-a-Service backend

It allows developers to focus on frontend logic while this API handles structured storage securely.

🧠 Core Concept

All documents are stored in one table with the following structure:

title → Name of the document

folder → Logical grouping (e.g., orders, messages, logs)

owner → User or company name

passkey_hash → Encrypted secret key

data → JSON content

created_at

updated_at

This creates a flexible document hub that supports multiple use cases inside one database.

🔐 Security Model

Each document is:

Tied to an owner

Protected by a secret passkey (bcrypt hashed)

Only users with correct credentials can:

Fetch

Update

Delete

List documents

⚙️ Features
✅ Create Document

Store any valid JSON under a folder and owner.

✅ Fetch Document (Secure)

Retrieve a single document using:

title

folder

owner

passkey

✅ Update Document

Update:

title

folder

owner

passkey

JSON data (full replacement)

✅ Delete Document

Securely remove a document.

✅ List Documents by Folder

Filter by:

owner

folder

passkey

Perfect for retrieving:

All orders

All messages

All logs

All reports

📦 Real-World Use Cases
🛒 E-commerce Prototype

Store incoming orders under:

folder: "orders"


Frontend can list all orders for dashboard display.

💬 Messaging System

Store messages under:

folder: "messages"


Retrieve all messages in one API call.

📊 Admin Dashboard

Store:

logs

activity reports

analytics data

All within structured folders.

🧪 Example Request
Create Document
POST /api/documents/create

{
  "title": "Order_001",
  "folder": "orders",
  "owner": "Acme Corp",
  "secret_passkey": "mySecret123",
  "data": {
    "customer": "John Doe",
    "items": 3,
    "total": 120
  }
}

🎯 Design Philosophy

This API intentionally:

Does NOT enforce strict schema

Does NOT create multiple relational tables

Does NOT restrict JSON structure

Instead:

The frontend defines structure.
The API securely stores and retrieves it.

This makes it ideal for:

Prototypes

Small apps

Learning projects

Flexible internal tools

⚖️ Trade-Off

Using a single-table JSON storage approach prioritizes:

✔ Simplicity
✔ Flexibility
✔ Speed
✔ Rapid development

Over:

✖ Complex relational querying
✖ Heavy analytics
✖ Enterprise-scale normalization

🚀 Future Improvements

JWT-based authentication

Owner-level authentication system

Rate limiting

JSON schema validation (optional)

Folder-level indexing

Advanced querying
